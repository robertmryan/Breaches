## Simple MVP/MVVM Demo

This is a quick and dirty demo of using MVP/MVVM patterns to pull business logic, network logic, etc. out of a view controller.

See https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/217706/54422.

Developed in Swift on Xcode 10.2.1 and Swift 5. But the basic ideas are equally applicable for different versions of Swift.
